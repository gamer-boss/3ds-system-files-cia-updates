so one day i was on my o3ds and i accidentally deleted health and safty info app. and i tried to reinstall it and so it just crashed every time i opened it. and then i decided to find the system cia's through delving into the internet to make them public and easy to find. so anyone with this sort of problem can get it fixed. i hope. good luck. :) ps: i dont know exactly what cia's these are so be carful.
